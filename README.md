## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, Font-Awesome, CSS Flexbox

I created reusable and efficient components with flexbox and the BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming convention. Increased productivity with Emmet and ES7 code snippets to push out a compelling front end design while also building components with state management top of mind. Heavily styled with CSS to have full control on styles to improve user experience. 

## Lessons Learned:

Styling with full CSS as opposed to either Styled Components or a library like Material-UI has its perks, but file structure can get busy so using a library or Styled Components may prove to be cleaner and more efficient. 

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
